### Project Overview

 We'll continue working with the weather dataset used in the previous project. We will further analyze the dataset and identify any trend using the Matplotlib library. The index of the dataset is the Date/Time instance at a gap of one hour in the year 2012.

Features:
Name	Description
Date/Time	Date & Time for each hour in the year 2012.
Temp(C)	Exact temperature at a given time.
Dew Point Temp(C)	Dew Point Temp at a given time. It is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor.
Rel Hum (%)	Relative Humidity at a given time.
Wind Spd (km/h)	Wind Speed in km/h at a given time.
Visibility (km)	Visibility in km at a given time.
Stn Press (kPa)	Station Pressure observed at that time.
Weather	Weather at a given time.
